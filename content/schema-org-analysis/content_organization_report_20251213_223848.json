Additionally, Alyshia shared her success in hiring a new part-time employee for Leora, her plans to set up website data analytics for Leora, and her focus on Airbnb properties to fund the company. Chandra Srivastava and Alyshia discussed the specialized language in academic fields, insights from Startup Grind, and the company's ownership structure as a women and minority-owned business, which could lead to grants. Alyshia also created a to-do list to unblock Micah, and John Skelton offered his support with manual labor for the Airbnb properties.\nDetails\nMeeting Logistics and Greetings Alyshia Ledlie initiated the meeting and addressed camera and screen setup issues, while Micah Lindsey mentioned that the official Thursday meeting might have been canceled. Alyshia offered to create a new, repeating meeting, and the participants exchanged greetings, with John Skelton joining later (00:00:00).\nCloud Service Discussion Micah Lindsey suggested using Google Cloud, believing it makes sense for their needs, especially after realizing they might require more CPU cores based on conversations with Chad GPT (00:00:00). Alyshia Ledlie confirmed the possibility of obtaining $2,000 in free Google Cloud credits through Tech Soup, and Micah also noted the availability of $25,000 in Azure credits for one year. They discussed the significant jump in Google Cloud credits if they receive funding, from $2,000 to $350,000, which made Google Cloud seem like a favorable option (00:01:25) (00:03:37).\nFunding and Accelerator Insights Alyshia Ledlie noted that acquiring accelerator funding could significantly ease operations and mentioned that they might be able to secure such funding, which should be pursued (00:02:29). She also recalled Tara's advice that they could apply for compute resources directly rather than solely relying on accelerators, indicating they have not yet sent in those applications (00:04:28).\nML Commons Participation Alyshia Ledlie shared her involvement with ML Commons, an open-source group focused on ML-based automation and backend data, and offered to add Micah Lindsey to relevant events on the Integrity Studio calendar (00:02:29) (00:06:40). She explained that while many discussions are beyond her depth, she primarily learns by listening and contributes most effectively in the risk management and measurement chat (00:05:36) (00:07:56). Alyshia humorously recounted how she gained access to ML Commons by highlighting past Facebook projects, which impressed the organization (00:06:40).\nPhilosophical and Technical Discussions Chandra Srivastava and Alyshia Ledlie discussed the specialized language used in certain academic and technical fields, viewing it as a barrier to entry. Alyshia highlighted the unexpected relevance of philosophy PhDs in metaontology and diffusion mathematics for current tech roles, particularly in multimodal neural networks, suggesting a shift in valuable skills within the industry (00:09:05).\nLeora Employee Acquisition Alyshia Ledlie successfully found a new employee for Leora, a social worker from Capitol City Village, who will work part-time while still in school (00:10:11). Alyshia emphasized the strategic importance of this hire for Leora's scaling efforts and for freeing up Monica's time, which ultimately benefits Integrity Studio (00:11:42). Chandra Srivastava acknowledged the value of a motivated grad student, and Alyshia highlighted the academic willingness to work for deferred benefits (00:11:42).\nWebsite Data Analytics Alyshia Ledlie mentioned plans to set up data analytics on Leora's website once she gains access, similar to setups she has done for other organizations and her blog. She noted that integrating analytics differs significantly between owning a website and using platforms like Wix or Web Flow, as platforms often charge extra for such functionalities. Chandra Srivastava expressed interest in observing Alyshia's setup process for future reference (00:12:40).\nPersonal Workload and Company Funding Alyshia Ledlie informed the team that she would be focusing on her Airbnb properties for the next 48 hours, as this is currently the primary method of funding their company. She explained that events like ACL and F1 create significant rental opportunities, which allow them to cover tools and potentially pay salaries. Chandra Srivastava encouraged Alyshia to prioritize this work without apology (00:17:23) (00:20:19).\nClient Questionnaire and Oay Bonsai Micah Lindsey suggested asking clients about their current solution costs to better tailor their offerings (00:21:17). Chandra Srivastava agreed, noting this question sh",

Additionally, Alyshia Ledlie is exploring qualifying as an alternate administrator for a home healthcare company to facilitate operations for Monica, investigating if their experience with the Advisory Board Company or as a CASA qualifies, and detailed efforts to reduce the client's operating expenses from $1,000 to $600-$700 monthly, aiming for $2,000 in profit by January to enable Monica and Ashley to leave their day jobs.\nDetails\nFestival Financials and Tax Deductions Alyshia Ledlie discussed the financial outcomes of a recent festival, noting a $23,285 tax deduction from Integrity Studios' contribution and a personal deduction of $2,500 (00:10:54). She explained that while no direct payment was received for their work, these deductions could be beneficial if the company generates significant profit by December (00:11:59). Alyshia Ledlie plans to send John Skelton the financial document prepared by Amy, who has extensive experience with non-profits, and requested John Skelton research the legality of splitting the tax deduction among individuals like Micah and Shandra (00:13:12).\nAdministrator Qualification Research Alyshia Ledlie is exploring the possibility of qualifying as an alternate administrator for a home healthcare company, which would allow them to use their address as the business address and be present for surveyor visits, simplifying operations for Monica and allowing Monica to take lucrative travel nurse contracts (00:18:03). Alyshia Ledlie has 13 months of experience from the Advisory Board Company that should qualify, and they are investigating if their three years as a CASA (Child Advocate Special Something), coordinating services for children in the CPS system, could also count towards the two-year administrative experience requirement for working with vulnerable populations (00:19:27) (00:24:59). If not, Alyshia Ledlie mentioned they might backdate their advisory work with Monica to meet the two-year requirement (00:24:59).\nClient Business Operations and Financial Strategy Alyshia Ledlie detailed their work with Monica to reduce operating expenses for their client's home healthcare company, bringing them down from approximately $1,000 to $600-$700 per month (00:15:31). The primary goal is to help the company achieve $2,000 a month in profit by January, enabling Monica and Ashley to eventually leave their day jobs. Alyshia Ledlie intends to continue reducing expenses and mentioned a key hurdle is the completion of their survey, which impacts their ability to scale and hire (00:16:48).\nSuggested next steps\nJohn Skelton will research the legality of splitting the tax deduction between Micah and Chandra and check with his dad about it.\nYou should review Gemini's notes to make sure they're accurate.

See lifecycle\n      management for more information.\n    LoggingValue: The bucket's logging configuration, which defines the\n      destination bucket and optional name prefix for the current bucket's\n      logs.\n    OwnerValue: The owner of the bucket. This is always the project team's\n      owner group.\n    RetentionPolicyValue: The bucket's retention policy. The retention policy\n      enforces a minimum retention time for all objects contained in the\n      bucket, based on their creation time. Any attempt to overwrite or delete\n      objects younger than the retention period will result in a\n      PERMISSION_DENIED error. An unlocked retention policy can be modified or\n      removed from the bucket via a storage.buckets.update operation. A locked\n      retention policy cannot be removed or shortened in duration for the\n      lifetime of the bucket. Attempting to remove or decrease period of a\n      locked retention policy will result in a PERMISSION_DENIED error.\n    VersioningValue: The bucket's versioning configuration.\n    WebsiteValue: The bucket's website configuration, controlling how the\n      service behaves when accessing bucket contents as a web site. See the\n      Static Website Examples for more information.\n\n  Fields:\n    acl: Access controls on the bucket.\n    autoclass: The bucket's Autoclass configuration.\n    billing: The bucket's billing configuration.\n    cors: The bucket's Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration.\n    customPlacementConfig: The bucket's custom placement configuration for\n      Custom Dual Regions.\n    defaultEventBasedHold: The default value for event-based hold on newly\n      created objects in this bucket. Event-based hold is a way to retain\n      objects indefinitely until an event occurs, signified by the hold's\n      release. After being released, such objects will be subject to bucket-\n      level retention (if any). One sample use case of this flag is for banks\n      to hold loan documents for at least 3 years after loan is paid in full.\n      Here, bucket-level retention is 3 years and the event is loan being paid\n      in full. In this example, these objects will be held intact for any\n      number of years until the event has occurred (event-based hold on the\n      object is released) and then 3 more years after that. That means\n      retention duration of the objects begins from the moment event-based\n      hold transitioned from true to false. Objects under event-based hold\n      cannot be deleted, overwritten or archived until the hold is removed.\n    defaultObjectAcl: Default access controls to apply to new objects when no\n      ACL is provided.\n    encryption: Encryption configuration for a bucket.\n    etag: HTTP 1.1 Entity tag for the bucket.\n    iamConfiguration: The bucket's IAM configuration.\n    id: The ID of the bucket. For buckets, the id and name properties are the\n      same.\n    kind: The kind of item this is. For buckets, this is always\n      storage#bucket.\n    labels: User-provided labels, in key/value pairs.\n    lifecycle: The bucket's lifecycle configuration. See lifecycle management\n      for more information.\n    location: The location of the bucket. Object data for objects in the\n      bucket resides in physical storage within this region. Defaults to US.\n      See the developer's guide for the authoritative list.\n    locationType: The type of the bucket location.\n ",

Specifically, this section discusses\n  how to script large production tasks around gsutil's resumable transfer\n  mechanism.\n\n\n<B>BACKGROUND ON RESUMABLE TRANSFERS</B>\n  First, it's helpful to understand gsutil's resumable transfer mechanism,\n  and how your script needs to be implemented around this mechanism to work\n  reliably. gsutil uses resumable transfer support when you attempt to download\n  a file of any size or to upload a file larger than a configurable threshold\n  (by default, this threshold is %d MiB). If a transfer fails partway through\n  (e.g., because of an intermittent network problem), gsutil uses a\n  `truncated randomized binary exponential backoff-and-retry strategy\n  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/retry-strategy#tools>`_ that by\n  default retries transfers up to 23 times over a 10 minute period of time. If\n  the transfer fails each of these attempts with no intervening progress,\n  gsutil gives up on the transfer, but keeps a \"tracker\" file for it in a\n  configurable location (the default location is ~/.gsutil/, in a file named\n  by a combination of the SHA1 hash of the name of the bucket and object being\n  transferred and the last 16 characters of the file name). When transfers\n  fail in this fashion, you can rerun gsutil at some later time (e.g., after\n  the networking problem has been resolved), and the resumable transfer picks\n  up where it left off.\n\n\n<B>SCRIPTING DATA TRANSFER TASKS</B>\n  To script large production data transfer tasks around this mechanism,\n  you can implement a script that runs periodically, determines which file\n  transfers have not yet succeeded, and runs gsutil to copy them. Below,\n  we offer a number of suggestions about how this type of scripting should\n  be implemented:\n\n  1. When resumable transfers fail without any progress 23 times in a row\n     over the course of up to 10 minutes, it probably won't work to simply\n     retry the transfer immediately. A more successful strategy would be to\n     have a cron job that runs every 30 minutes, determines which transfers\n     need to be run, and runs them. If the network experiences intermittent\n     problems, the script picks up where it left off and will eventually\n     succeed (once the network problem has been resolved).\n\n  2. If your business depends on timely data transfer, you should consider\n     implementing some network monitoring. For example, you can implement\n     a task that attempts a small download every few minutes and raises an\n     alert if the attempt fails for several attempts in a row (or more or less\n     frequently depending on your requirements), so that your IT staff can\n     investigate problems promptly. As usual with monitoring implementations,\n     you should experiment with the alerting thresholds, to avoid false\n     positive alerts that cause your staff to begin ignoring the alerts.\n\n  3. There are a variety of ways you can determine what files remain to be\n     transferred. We recommend that you avoid attempting to get a complete\n     listing of a bucket containing many objects (e.g., tens of thousands\n     or more). One strategy is to structure your object names in a way that\n     represents your transfer process, and use gsutil prefix wildcards to\n     request partial bucket listings. For example, if your periodic process\n     involves downloading the current day's objects, you could name objects\n     using a year-month-day-object-ID format and then find today's objects by\n     using a command like gsutil ls \"gs://bucket/2011-09-27-*\". Note that it\n     is more efficient to have a non-wildcard prefix like this than to use\n     something like gsutil ls \"gs://bucket/*-2011-09-27\". The latter command\n     actually requests a complete bucket listing and then filters in gsutil,\n     while the former asks Google Storage to return the subset ",

A registered agent must be: 1) an individual resident of Texas; or 2) an organization, other than the organization to be represented, that is registered or authorized to do business in Texas. The registered office address must be located at a street address where service of process may be personally served on the entity's registered agent during normal business hours. Although the registered office is not required to be the entity's principal place of business, the registered office address may not be solely the address of a company that provides mailbox services or telephone answering service (BOC \u00a7 5,201). \nHouse Bill 1787, effective January 1, 2010, amended subchapter E of chapter 5 of the Texas Business Organizations Code (BOC) to establish the requirement that a person appointed or named as an entity's registered agent must have consented, in a written or electronic form, to serve in that capacity. \nConsent: The appointment of a person as registered agent by an organizer or managerial official of an entity is an affirmation by the organizer or managerial official that the person has consented to serve in the capacity of registered agent. In addition, before the sale, acquisition, or transfer of a majority-in- interest or majority interest of the outstanding ownership or membership interests",

This form and the information\nprovided are not substitutes for the advice and services of an attorney.\n\nCommentary\n\nA domestic filing entity and a foreign filing entity registered to do business in Texas are required to\ncontinuously maintain a registered agent and a registered office address in Texas. A registered agent\nmust be: 1) an individual resident of Texas; or 2) an organization, other than the organization to be\nrepresented, that is registered or authorized to do business in Texas. The registered office address must\nbe located at a street address where service of process may be personally served on the entity\u2019s\nregistered agent during normal business hours. Although the registered office is not required to be the\nentity\u2019s principal place of business, the registered office address may not be solely the address of a\ncompany that provides mailbox services or telephone answering service (BOC \u00a7 5.201).\n\nHouse Bill 1787, effective January 1, 2010, amended subchapter E of chapter 5 of the Texas Business\nOrganizations Code (BOC) to establish the requirement that a person appointed or named as an entity\u2019s\nregistered agent must have consented, in a written or electronic form, to serve in that capacity.\n\nConsent: The appointment of a person as registered agent by an organizer or managerial official of an\nentity is an affirmation by the organizer or managerial official that the person has consented to serve in\nthe capacity of registered agent. In addition, before the sale, acquisition, or transfer of a majority-in-\ninterest or majority interest of the outstanding ownership or membership interests of a represented\nentity, the governing authority of the entity must verify whether the person named as the registered\nagent of the entity prior to the sale, acquisition, or transfer has consented to continue to serve the\nrepresented entity in that capacity.\n\nForm: Section 5.201(b) requires that a person who is to be named as the registered agent of a\nrepresented entity in a registered agent filing must consent, in a written or electronic form, to serve in\nthat capacity. A registered agent filing is defined by section 5.200(1) and includes any filing instrument\nthat designates or appoints a registered agent or that effects a change or correction to the registered agent\nsuch as a certificate of formation, certificate",

We'd like to only\n    # wrap those methods in the leaves of the inheritance tree, but we can't\n    # know when we're a leaf at wrapping time.  So instead we wrap all the\n    # setUp, tearDown, and test* methods, but code them so that we only do the\n    # counting we want at the leaves, which we *can* detect when we've got an\n    # actual instance to look at --- i.e. self, when a method is running.\n\n    # Because we're wrapping at every level of inheritance, some methods get\n    # wrapped multiple times down the inheritance chain; if SubClass were to\n    # inherit, say, setUp or testFoo from BaseClass, that method would be\n    # wrapped twice, first by BaseClass then by SubClass.  That's OK, because we\n    # ensure that the extra code we inject with these wrappers is idempotent.\n\n    # test_na",

Please\n  see the `Signed URLs documentation\n  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls>`_ for\n  background about signed URLs.\n\n  Multiple gs:// URLs may be provided and may contain wildcards. A signed URL\n  will be produced for each provided URL, authorized\n  for the specified HTTP method and valid for the given duration.\n\n  NOTE: Unlike the gsutil ls command, the signurl command does not support\n  operations on sub-directories. For example, unless you have an object named\n  ``some-directory/`` stored inside the bucket ``some-bucket``, the following\n  command returns an error: ``gsutil signurl <private-key-file> gs://some-bucket/some-directory/``\n\n  The signurl command uses the private key for a service account (the\n  '<private-key-file>' argument) to generate the cryptographic\n  signature for the generated URL. The private key file must be in PKCS12\n  or JSON format. If the private key is encrypted the signed URL command will\n  prompt for the passphrase used to protect the private key file\n  (default 'notasecret'). For more information regarding generating a private\n  key for use with the signurl command please see the `Authentication\n  documentation.\n  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication#generating-a-private-key>`_\n\n  If you used `service account credentials\n  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/addlhelp/CredentialTypesSupportingVariousUseCases#supported-credential-types_1>`_\n  for authentication, you can replace the  <private-key-file> argument with\n  the -u or --use-service-account option to use the system-managed private key\n  directly. This avoids the need to store a private key file locally, but\n  prior to using this flag you must `configure\n  <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/activate-service-account>`_\n  ``",

This is useful to restrict the\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM) permissions that a short-lived credential\ncan use.\n\nTo downscope permissions of a source credential, a Credential Access Boundary\nthat specifies which resources the new credential can access, as well as\nan upper bound on the permissions that are available on each resource, has to\nbe defined. A downscoped credential can then be instantiated using the source\ncredential and the Credential Access Boundary.\n\nThe common pattern of usage is to have a token broker with elevated access\ngenerate these downscoped credentials from higher access source credentials and\npass the downscoped short-lived access tokens to a token consumer via some\nsecure authenticated channel for limited access to Google Cloud Storage\nresources.\n\nFor example, a token broker can be set up on a server in a private network.\nVarious workloads (token consumers) in the same network will send authenticated\nrequests to that broker for downscoped tokens to access or modify specific google\ncloud storage buckets.\n\nThe broker will instantiate downscoped credentials instances that can be used to\ngenerate short lived downscoped access tokens that can be passed to the token\nconsumer. These downscoped access tokens can be injected by the consumer into\ngoogle.oauth2.Credentials and used to initialize a storage client instance to\naccess Google Cloud Storage resources with restricted access.\n\nNote: Only Cloud Storage supports Credential Access Boundaries.

Update the rotation schedule for the given key.\n\n  Updates the rotation schedule for the given key. The schedule\n  automatically creates a new primary version for the key\n  according to `next-rotation-time` and `rotation-period` flags.\n\n  Flag `next-rotation-time` must be in ISO 8601 or RFC3339 format,\n  and `rotation-period` must be in the form INTEGER[UNIT], where units\n  can be one of seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h) or days (d).\n\n  Key rotations performed manually via `update-primary-version` and the\n  version `create` do not affect the stored `next-rotation-time`.\n\n  2. Remove the rotation schedule for the given key with\n  `remove-rotation-schedule` flag.\n\n  3. Update/Remove the labels for the given key with `update-labels` and/or\n  `remove-labels` flags.\n\n  4. Update the primary version for the given key with `primary-version` flag.\n\n  5. Update the Key Access Justifications policy for the given key with\n  `allowed-access-reasons` flag to allow specified reasons. The key must be\n  enrolled in Key Access Justifications to use this flag.\n\n  6. Remove the Key Access Justifications policy for the given key with\n  `remove-key-access-justifications-policy` flag. The key must be enrolled in\n  Key Access Justifications to use this flag.\n\n  7. Update the Key Access Justifications policy for the given key with\n  `allowed_access_reasons` flag to allow zero access reasons. This effectively\n  disables the key, because a policy is configured to reject all access reasons.\n  The key must be enrolled in Key Access Justifications to use this flag.\n\n  ## EXAMPLES\n\n  The following command sets a 30 day rotation period for the key\n  named `frodo` within the keyring `fellowship` and location `global`\n  starting at the specified time:\n\n    $ {command} frodo \\\n        --location=global \\\n        --keyring=fellowship \\\n        --rotation-period=30d \\\n        --next-rotation-time=2017-10-12T12:34:56.1234Z\n\n  The following command removes the rotation schedule for the key\n  named `frodo` within the keyring `fellowship` and location `global`:\n\n    $ {command} frodo \\\n        --location=global \\\n        --keyring=fellowship \\\n        --remove-rotation-schedule\n\n  The following command updates the labels value for the key\n  named `frodo` within the keyring `fellowship` and location `global`. If the\n  label key does not exist at the time, it will be added:\n\n    $ {command} frodo \\\n        --location=global \\\n        --keyring=fellowship \\\n        --update-labels=k1=v1\n\n  The following command removes labels k1 and k2 from the key\n  named `frodo` within the keyring `fellowship` and location `global`:\n\n    $ {command} frodo \\\n        --location=global \\\n        --keyring=fellowship \\\n        --remove-labels=k1,k2\n\n  The following command updates the primary version for the key\n  named `frodo` within the keyring `fellowship` and location `global`:\n\n    $ {command} frodo \\\n        --location=global \\\n        --keyring=fellowship \\\n        --primary-version=1\n\n  The following command updates the default algorithm for the key named `frodo`\n  within the keyring `fellowship` and location `global`, assuming the key\n  originally has purpose 'asymmetric-encryption' and algorithm\n  'rsa-decrypt-oaep-2048-sha256':\n\n    $ {command} frodo \\\n        --location=global \\\n        --keyring=fellowship \\\n        --default-algorithm=rsa-decrypt-oaep-4096-sha256\n\n  The following command updates the Key Access Justifications policy for the key\n  named `frodo` within the keyring ``fellowship'' and location ``global'' to\n  allow only ``customer-initiated-access'' and\n  ``google-initiate",

If you installed gsutil via the Cloud SDK,\n  ``gsutil config`` fails unless you are specifically using the ``-a`` flag or\n  have configured gcloud to not pass its managed credentials to gsutil (via the\n  command ``gcloud config set pass_credentials_to_gsutil false``). For all other\n  use cases, Cloud SDK users should use the ``gcloud auth`` group of commands\n  instead, which configures OAuth2 credentials that gcloud implicitly passes to\n  gsutil at runtime. To check if you are using gsutil from the Cloud SDK or as a\n  legacy standalone, use ``gsutil version -l`` and in the output look for\n  \"using cloud sdk\".\n\n  Important: The default behavior for the ``gsutil config`` command is to obtain\n  user account credentials for authentication. However, user account credentials\n  are no longer supported for standalone gsutil. For this reason, running the\n  default ``gsutil config`` command fails, and using any of the following flags\n  causes the command to fail: ``-b``, ``-f``, ``-r``, ``--reauth``, ``-s``,\n  ``-w``. When using standalone gsutil, it's recommended that you use\n  service account credentials via the ``-e`` flag.\n\n  The ``gsutil config`` command obtains access credentials for Cloud Storage and\n  writes a `boto/gsutil configuration file\n  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/boto-gsutil>`_ containing\n  the obtained credentials along with a number of other configuration-\n  controllable values.\n\n  Unless specified otherwise (see OPTIONS), the configuration file is written\n  to ~/.boto (i.e., the file .boto under the user's home directory). If the\n  default file already exists, an attempt is made to rename the existing file\n  to ~/.boto.bak; if that attempt fails the command exits. A different\n  destination file can be specified with the ``-o`` option (see OPTIONS).\n\n  Because the boto configuration file contains your credentials you should\n  keep its file permissions set so no one but you has read access. (The file\n  is created read-only when you run ``gsutil config``.)\n\n\n<B>CONFIGURING SERVICE ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS</B>\n  Service accounts are useful for authenticating on behalf of a service or\n  application (as opposed to a user). If you use gsutil as a legacy\n  stand-alone tool, you configure credentials for service accounts using the\n  ``-e`` option:\n\n    gsutil config -e\n\n  Note that if you use gsutil through the Cloud SDK, you instead activate your\n  service account via the `gcloud auth activate-service-account\n  <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/activate-service-account>`_\n  command.\n\n  When you run ``gsutil config -e``, you are prompted for the path to your\n  private key file and, if not using a JSON key file, your service account\n  ",

This is also important\n  because gsutil uses \"bearer tokens\" for authentication (OAuth2) as well as for\n  resumable upload identifiers, and such tokens must be protected from being\n  eavesdropped and reused.\n\n  gsutil also supports the older HMAC style of authentication via the XML API\n  (see `gsutil endpoints\n  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/request-endpoints#gsutil>`_).  While\n  HMAC authentication does not use bearer tokens (and thus is not subject to\n  eavesdropping/replay attacks), it's still important to encrypt data traffic.\n  \n  To add an extra layer of security, gsutil supports mutual TLS (mTLS) for\n  the Cloud Storage JSON API. With mTLS, the client verifies the server\n  certificate, and the server also verifies the client.\n  To find out more about how to enable mTLS, see the `install docs\n  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install>`_.\n\n\n<B>LOCAL FILE STORAGE SECURITY</B>\n  gsutil takes a number of precautions to protect against security exploits in\n  the files it stores locally:\n\n  - When the ``gcloud init``, ``gsutil config -a``, or ``gsutil config -e``\n    commands run, they set file protection mode 600 (\"-rw-------\") on the .boto\n    configuration file they generate, so only the user (or superuser) can read\n    it. This is important because these files contain security-sensitive\n    information, including credentials and proxy configuration.\n\n  - These commands also use file protection mode 600 for the private key file\n    stored locally when you create service account credentials.\n\n  - The default level of logging output from gsutil commands does not include\n    security-sensitive information, such as OAuth2 tokens and proxy\n    configuration information. (See the \"RECOMMENDED USER PRECAUTIONS\" section\n    below if you increase the level of debug output, using the gsutil -D\n    option.)\n\n  Note that protection modes are not supported on Windows, so if you\n  use gsutil on Windows we recommend using an encrypted file system and strong\n  account passwords.\n\n\n<B>SECURITY-SENSITIVE FILES WRITTEN TEMPORARILY TO DISK BY GSUTIL</B>\n  gsutil buffers data in temporary files in several situations:\n\n  - While compressing data being uploaded via gsutil cp -z/-Z, gsutil\n    buffers the data in temporary files with protection 600, which it\n    deletes after the upload is complete (similarly for downloading files\n    that were uploaded with gsutil cp -z/-Z or some other process that sets the\n    Content-Encoding to \"gzip\"). However, if you kill the gsutil process\n    while the upload is under way the partially written file will be left\n    in place. See the \"CHANGING TEMP DIRECTORIES\" section in\n    \"gsutil help cp\" for details of where the temporary files are written\n    and how to change the temp directory location.\n\n  - When performing a resumable upload gsutil stores the upload ID (which,\n    as noted above, is a bearer token and thus should be safe-guarded) in a\n    file under ~/.gsutil/tracker-files with protection 600, and deletes this\n    file after the upload is complete. However, if the upload doesn't\n    complete successfully the tracker file is left in place so the resumable\n    upload can be re-attempted later. Over time it's possible to accumulate\n    these tracker files from aborted upload attempts, though resumable\n    upload IDs are only valid for 1 week, so the security risk only exists\n    for files less than that age. If you consider the risk of leaving\n    aborted upload IDs in the tracker directory too high you could modify\n    your upload scripts to delete the tracker files; or you could create a\n    cron job to clear the tracker directory periodically.\n\n  - The gsutil rsync command stores temporary files (wit",

Compute API\nfilter expressions have limited functionality and are not compatible with\nOne Platform. This module rewrites client-side filter expressions to compute\nserver-side filter expressions. Both the client-side and server-side\nexpressions must be applied.\n\nCompute API filter expressions have these operators:\n  eq\n  ne\nand these operand types:\n  string\n  bool\n  integer\n  float\n\neq and ne on string operands treat the operand as a regular expression pattern.\nThe patterns must completely match the entire string (they are implicitly\nanchored).  The ~ operator is implicitly unanchored, so there are some gyrations\nin the ~ and !~ RE rewrite code to handle that.  Multiple terms can be AND'ed\nby enclosing adjacent terms in parenthesis.\n\nExplicit AND, OR or NOT operators are not supported.\n\nTo use in compute Run(args) methods:\n\n  from googlecloudsdk.api_lib.compute import filter_rewrite\n    ...\n  args.filter, backend_filter = filter_rewrite.Rewriter().Rewrite(args.filter)\n    ...\n    filter=backend_filter,\n    ...\n  )\n\nWhen compute becomes One Platform compliant this module can be discarded and\nthe compute code can simply use\n\n  Request(\n    ...\n    filter=args.filter,\n    ...\n  )\n\nCompute query parsing is finicky with respect to spaces. Some are OK, some\naren't. Don't fiddle with the spacing in the list => string code without\nverifying against the actual compute implementation.\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom __future__ import absolute_import\nfrom __future__ import division\nfrom __future__ import unicode_literals\n\nimport re\n\nfrom apitools.base.protorpclite import messages\nfrom googlecloudsdk.core.resource import resource_expr_rewrite\nfrom googlecloudsdk.core.util import times\n\nimport six\n\n\ndef _EscapePattern(pattern):\n  \"\"\"Escapes special regex characters and double quotes in the pattern.\n\n  This is basically identical to Python 3.7's implementation of re.escape(),\n  except that it also includes double quotes in the set of characters that need\n  escaping (needed for proper filter rewriting behavior).\n\n  Args:\n    pattern: A regex pattern.\n\n  Returns:\n    The pattern with double quotes and special regex characters escaped.\n  \"\"\"\n  special_chars_map = {\n      i: '\\\\' + chr(i)\n      for i in six.iterbytes(b'\"()[]{}?*+-|^$\\\\.&~# \\t\\n\\r\\v\\f')}\n  return pattern.translate(special_chars_map)\n\n\ndef ConvertEQPatternToFullMatch(pattern):\n  r\"\"\"Returns filter = pattern converted to a full match RE pattern.\n\n  This function converts pattern such that the compute filter expression\n    subject eq ConvertEQPatternToFullMatch(pattern)\n  matches (the entire subject matches) IFF\n    re.search(r'\\b' + _EscapePattern(pattern) + r'\\b', subject)\n  matches (pattern matches anywhere in subject).\n\n  Args:\n    pattern: A filter = pattern that partially matches the subject string.\n\n  Returns:\n    The converted = pattern suitable for the compute eq filter match operator.\n  \"\"\"\n  return r'\".*\\b{pattern}\\b.*\"'.format(pattern=_EscapePattern(pattern))\n\n\ndef ConvertHASPatternToFullMatch(pattern):\n  r\"\"\"Returns filter : pattern converted to a full match RE pattern.\n\n  This function converts pattern such that the compute filter expression\n    subject eq ConvertREPatternToFullMatch(pattern)\n  matches (the entire subject matches) IFF\n    re.search(r'\\b' + _EscapePattern(pattern) + r'\\b', subject)  # no trailing *\n    re.search(r'\\b' + _EscapePattern(pattern[:-1]), subject)     # trailing *\n  matches (pattern matches anywhere in subject).\n\n  Args:\n    pattern: A filter : pattern that partially matches the subject string.\n\n  Returns:\n    The converted : pattern suitable for the compute eq filter match operator.\n  \"\"\"\n  left = r'.*\\b'\n  if pattern.endswith('*'):\n    # OnePlatform : operator unanchored right.\n    pattern = pattern[:-1]\n    right = '.*'\n  else:\n    right = r'\\b.*'\n  return r'\"{left}{pattern}{right}\"'.format(\n      left=left, pattern=_EscapePattern(pattern), right=right)\n\n\ndef ConvertREPatternToFullMatch(pattern, wordmatch=False):\n  \"\"\"Returns filter ~ pattern converted to a full match RE pattern.\n\n  This function converts pattern such that the compute filter expression\n    subject eq ConvertREPatternToFullMatch(pattern)\n  matches (the entire subje",

Several test files will be uploaded to and downloaded\n  from this bucket. All test files will be deleted at the completion of the\n  diagnostic if it finishes successfully. For a list of relevant permissions,\n  see `Cloud IAM permissions for gsutil commands\n  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-gsutil>`_.\n\n  gsutil performance can be influenced by a number of factors originating\n  at the client, server, or network level. Some examples include the\n  following:\n  \n   + CPU speed\n   + Available memory\n   + The access path to the local disk\n   + Network bandwidth\n   + Contention and error rates along the path between gsutil and Google servers\n   + Operating system buffering configuration\n   + Firewalls and other network elements\n  \n  The `perfdiag` command is provided so that customers can run a known\n  measurement suite when troubleshooting performance problems.\n\n\n<B>PROVIDING DIAGNOSTIC OUTPUT TO THE CLOUD STORAGE TEAM</B>\n  If the Cloud Storage team asks you to run a performance diagnostic\n  please use the following command, and email the output file (output.json)\n  to the @google.com address provided by the Cloud Storage team:\n\n    gsutil perfdiag -o output.json gs://your-bucket\n\n  Additional resources for discussing ``perfdiag`` results include the\n  `Stack Overflow tag for Cloud Storage\n  <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-cloud-storage>`_ and\n  the `gsutil GitHub repository\n  <https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gsutil/issues>`_.\n\n\n<B>OPTIONS</B>\n  -n          Sets the number of objects to use when downloading and uploading\n              files during tests.

Expressions are composed\n          of terms connected by logic operators.\n\n          *LogicOperator*::\n\n          Logic operators must be in uppercase: *AND*, *OR*, *NOT*.\n          Additionally, expressions containing both *AND* and *OR* must be\n          parenthesized to disambiguate precedence.\n\n          *NOT* _term-1_:::\n\n          True if _term-1_ is False, otherwise False.\n\n          _term-1_ *AND* _term-2_:::\n\n          True if both _term-1_ and _term-2_ are true.\n\n          _term-1_ *OR* _term-2_:::\n\n          True if at least one of _term-1_ or _term-2_ is true.\n\n          _term-1_ _term-2_:::\n\n          Term conjunction (implicit *AND*) is True if both _term-1_\n          and _term-2_ are true.  Conjunction has lower precedence than *OR*.\n\n          *Terms*::\n\n          A term is a _key_ _operator_ _value_ tuple, where _key_ is a dotted\n          name that evaluates to the value of a resource attribute, and _value_\n          may be:\n\n          *number*::: integer or floating point numeric constant\n\n          *unquoted literal*::: character sequence terminated by space, ( or )\n\n          *quoted literal*::: _\"...\"_ or _'...'_\n\n          Most filter expressions need to be quoted in shell commands. If you\n          use _'...'_ shell quotes then use _\"...\"_ filter string literal quotes\n          and vice versa.\n\n          Quoted literals will be interpreted as string values, even when the\n          value could also be a valid number. For example, 'key:1e9' will be\n          interpreted as a key named 'key' with the string value '1e9', rather\n          than with the float value of one billion expressed in scientific\n          notation.\n\n          *Operator Terms*::\n\n          _key_ *:* _simple-pattern_:::\n\n          *:* operator evaluation is changing for consistency across Google\n          APIs.  The current default is deprecated and will be dropped shortly.\n          A warning will be displayed when a --filter expression would return\n          different matches using both the deprecated and new implementations.\n          +\n          The current deprecated default is True if _key_ contains\n          _simple-pattern_.  The match is case insensitive.  It allows one\n          ```*``` that matches any sequence of 0 or more characters.\n          If ```*``` is specified then the match is anchored, meaning all\n          characters from the beginning and end of the value must match.\n          +\n          The new implementation is True if _simple-pattern_ matches any\n          _word_ in _key_.  Words are locale specific but typically consist of\n          alpha-numeric characters.  Non-word characters that do not appear in\n          _simple-pattern_ are ignored.  The matching is anchored and case\n          insensitive.  An optional trailing ```*``` does a word prefix match.\n          +\n          Use _key_```:*``` to test if _key_ is defined and\n          ```-```_key_```:*``` to test if _key_ is undefined.\n\n          _key_ *:(* _simple-pattern_ ... *)*:::\n\n          True if _key_ matches any _simple-pattern_ in the\n          (space, tab, newline, comma) separated list.\n\n          _key_ *=* _value_:::\n\n          True if _key_ is equal to _value_, or [deprecated] equivalent to *:*\n          with the exception that the trailing ```*``` prefix match is not\n          supported.\n          +\n          For historical reasons, this operation currently behaves differently\n          for different Google APIs. For many APIs, this is True if key is\n          equal to value. For a few APIs, this is currently equivalent to *:*,\n          w",

This is useful to restrict the\nIdentity and Access Management (IAM) permissions that a short-lived credential\ncan use.\n\nTo downscope permissions of a source credential, a Credential Access Boundary\nthat specifies which resources the new credential can access, as well as\nan upper bound on the permissions that are available on each resource, has to\nbe defined. A downscoped credential can then be instantiated using the source\ncredential and the Credential Access Boundary.\n\nThe common pattern of usage is to have a token broker with elevated access\ngenerate these downscoped credentials from higher access source credentials and\npass the downscoped short-lived access tokens to a token consumer via some\nsecure authenticated channel for limited access to Google Cloud Storage\nresources.\n\nFor example, a token broker can be set up on a server in a private network.\nVarious workloads (token consumers) in the same network will send authenticated\nrequests to that broker for downscoped tokens to access or modify specific google\ncloud storage buckets.\n\nThe broker will instantiate downscoped credentials instances that can be used to\ngenerate short lived downscoped access tokens that can be passed to the token\nconsumer. These downscoped access tokens can be injected by the consumer into\ngoogle.oauth2.Credentials and used to initialize a storage client instance to\naccess Google Cloud Storage resources with restricted access.\n\nNote: Only Cloud Storage supports Credential Access Boundaries.
