I work at the intersection of trust, safety, and data—helping organizations identify and combat platform abuse, fraud, and bad actors at scale.

As a **Trust & Safety Professional at Integrity Studio**, I bring over 15 years of experience in business integrity, fraud analysis, and data-driven investigations. My background spans gaming, enterprise software, and social media platforms, with deep expertise in building processes and pipelines to detect and enforce against abusive behavior.

**What drives my work:** A conviction that safe platforms and honest ecosystems don't happen by accident. They require rigorous investigation, smart automation, and teams that understand both the data and the human behavior behind it.

## Focus Areas

### Business Integrity & Trust and Safety

Platform integrity requires constant vigilance—identifying patterns of abuse, building enforcement systems, and staying ahead of bad actors who adapt. I've spent over 8 years at Meta doing exactly this, from the early days of Traffic Quality Investigations through Actor Level Enforcement.

### Fraud Prevention & Detection

From gaming fraud to advertising platform abuse, my career has centered on finding the signal in the noise. I specialize in creating and maintaining SQL-based data pipelines, performing signal analysis, and developing scalable enforcement strategies.

### Data Analysis & Reporting

Clear, actionable data is the foundation of effective trust and safety work. I have extensive experience creating standardized SQL scripts, automated reporting systems, and ad hoc analyses that help management teams make informed decisions.
