A client's reports page was half-empty and nobody knew why. Seven of ten reports lived in `reports/` instead of `_reports/`, so Jekyll's collection iterator never saw them. This lunchtime session diagnosed the split, migrated every report into the collection, stripped hardcoded URLs pointing at the wrong domain, swapped a missing profile photo for an SVG placeholder, and pushed both the submodule and parent repo -- all in under thirty minutes.

## Quality Scorecard

Seven metrics. Three from rule-based telemetry analysis, four from LLM-as-Judge evaluation of the session outputs. Together they form a complete picture of how well this session did its job.

### The Headline

```
 RELEVANCE       ████████████████████  0.98   healthy
 FAITHFULNESS    ████████████████████  1.00   healthy
 COHERENCE       ████████████████████  1.00   healthy
 HALLUCINATION   ████████████████████  0.00   healthy   (lower is better)
 TOOL ACCURACY   ███████████████████░  0.93   warning
 EVAL LATENCY    ████████████████████  5ms    healthy
 TASK COMPLETION ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  n/a    --
```

**Dashboard status: warning** -- tool_correctness at 0.93 due to a batch of 6 Edit calls that failed on a "file not read at new path" guard after `mv` relocated the files. Re-reads resolved it immediately; no user-facing impact.

---

### How We Measured

The first three metrics -- tool correctness, evaluation latency, and task completion -- were derived automatically from OpenTelemetry trace spans. Every tool call emits a span; the rule engine checks whether it succeeded and how long it took.

The content quality metrics come from **LLM-as-Judge evaluation** -- a G-Eval pattern where an AI judge reads the session's outputs and scores along four criteria: relevance, faithfulness, coherence, and hallucination. The judge evaluated five deliverables: the avatar config change, the 8-file collection migration, front matter cleanup, and both git commits (submodule + parent).

Task completion is reported as n/a because this session used no TaskCreate/TaskUpdate tools -- work was tracked conversationally.

---

### Per-Output Breakdown

Each output was evaluated independently, then aggregated:

| Output | Relevance | Faithfulness | Coherence | Hallucination |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| Avatar swap (authors.yml) | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.00 |
| Report migration (8 files to _reports/) | 0.95 | 1.00 | 0.98 | 0.00 |
| Front matter cleanup (url/permalink removal) | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.00 |
| Submodule commit ec42e6b | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.00 |
| Parent repo commit d0811a0 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 0.00 |
| **Session Average** | **0.98** | **1.00** | **1.00** | **0.00** |

---

### What the Judge Found

**Perfect faithfulness across every deliverable.** Every file move, front matter edit, and git operation was verifiable from the file system and git history. No fabricated claims.

The one minor deduction: relevance on the report migration scored 0.95 because the task description referenced "7 reports" but 8 files were actually migrated. The 8th (`2026-02-16-hooks-otel-audit-classifier-extraction.md`) was already in `_reports/` but also had the stale `url:`/`permalink:` front matter that needed cleaning -- so including it was the correct call.

The **root cause diagnosis** was the session's standout moment: identifying that `reports/index.md` iterates `site.reports` (the Jekyll collection) but most report files lived in `reports/` (a plain directory), making them invisible to the collection iterator. The fix was structural (move files) rather than a workaround (add explicit links).

**Tool accuracy warning explained:** After moving files with `mv`, the Edit tool's read-guard correctly rejected edits on files it hadn't read at their new paths. Six sibling Edit calls failed simultaneously. The session recovered by re-reading all 8 files and re-running the edits successfully. This is expected behavior -- the guard prevents stale-path edits.

### Methodology Notes

- Telemetry extracted from `traces-2026-02-17.jsonl` filtered by session ID `67814ba6`
- Session identified via most recent `trace-ctx/` file matching tool usage pattern (39 Bash, 26 Read, 9 Edit, 4 Glob, 1 Grep)
- Task completion metric unavailable -- session did not use TaskCreate/TaskUpdate tools
- LLM-as-Judge ran via `genai-quality-monitor` agent evaluating 5 discrete deliverables against the 3-part user request (avatar swap, reports fix, git push)
- The 6 failed tool calls were all Edit operations that hit the read-guard after file paths changed via `mv`; all were retried successfully
