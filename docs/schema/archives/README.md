# Schema Documentation Archives

**Archived:** 2026-01-19

This directory contains historical schema documentation that has been superseded by consolidated documentation.

## Why Archived?

These documents were consolidated to reduce duplication and create a cleaner documentation structure:

- **blog-enhancement-analysis.md** - Merged into `IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md`
- **blog-enhancement-summary.md** - Merged into `IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md`
- **enhanced-implementation-guide.md** - Merged into `IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md`
- **knowledge-graph-guide.md** - Merged into `IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md`
- **testing-validation-guide.md** - Merged into `TESTING-AND-MONITORING.md`
- **search-console-monitoring.md** - Merged into `TESTING-AND-MONITORING.md`
- **implementation-complete.md** - One-time implementation status (no longer needed)

## Entity Analysis

The `entity-analysis/` subdirectory contains page-specific entity analysis documents:

- `about-page.md` - Entity suggestions for the About page
- `blog-post.md` - Entity suggestions for blog posts
- `vita-homage.md` - Entity suggestions for CV/memorial pages

These are implementation suggestions that may still be useful for reference when adding entity mentions to schema markup.
