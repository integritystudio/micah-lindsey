How do you review twenty-six thousand lines of production code in a single sitting? You don't -- you split the problem. This Valentine's Day session launched six code-reviewer agents in parallel, each specializing in a different layer of the observability-toolkit stack. Ninety-one trace spans later, the results converged into 83 prioritized findings and a clean commit to the backlog.

## Quality Scorecard

Seven metrics. Three from rule-based telemetry analysis, four from LLM-as-Judge evaluation of the session outputs. Together they form a complete picture of how well this session did its job.

### The Headline

```
 RELEVANCE       ████████████████████  1.00   healthy
 FAITHFULNESS    ███████████████████░  0.97   healthy
 COHERENCE       ███████████████████░  0.97   healthy
 HALLUCINATION   ███████████████████░  0.04   healthy   (lower is better)
 TOOL ACCURACY   ████████████████████  1.00   healthy
 EVAL LATENCY    ████████████████████  0.004s healthy
 TASK COMPLETION ████████████████████  1.00   healthy
```

**Dashboard status: healthy** -- All seven metrics in the green. Tool accuracy and task completion at ceiling; LLM-as-Judge scores above 0.96 across the board; hallucination well below the 0.05 threshold.

### How We Measured

The first three metrics -- tool correctness, evaluation latency, and task completion -- were derived automatically from OpenTelemetry trace spans. Every tool call emits a span; the rule engine checks whether it succeeded and how long it took. Across 64 tool spans and 2 task completions, every call succeeded with sub-5ms hook latency.

The content quality metrics come from **LLM-as-Judge evaluation** -- a G-Eval pattern where a Sonnet judge read both session outputs (the review document and the updated backlog) and scored along four criteria. The judge also spot-checked 10+ file:line references against actual source files to verify faithfulness.

### Per-Output Breakdown

Each output was evaluated independently, then aggregated:

| Document | Relevance | Faithfulness | Coherence | Hallucination |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| `docs/reviews/full-stack-review-2026-02-14.md` (~400 lines) | 1.00 | 0.95 | 0.95 | 0.05 |
| `docs/BACKLOG.md` (+334 lines) | 1.00 | 0.98 | 0.98 | 0.02 |
| **Session Average** | **1.00** | **0.97** | **0.97** | **0.04** |

### What the Judge Found

The **backlog update scored highest** across all dimensions -- perfect relevance, near-perfect faithfulness (0.98), and minimal hallucination (0.02). Every item was accurately transcribed from the review with correct file:line references and proper priority classification.

The **review document** scored slightly lower on faithfulness (0.95) due to one nuance: the C2 finding claimed `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS` is "not enforced on all fetch calls," when the timeout is actually used with `setTimeout` at line 433. The underlying security concern is valid -- not all code paths enforce it consistently -- but the wording slightly overstated the gap.

Hallucination was minimal across both outputs. The review added contextual risk assessments ("DoS risk," "O(n^2) behavior") that are technically inferences rather than direct code observations, but all were reasonable and defensible. The backlog added P0-P4 priority labels not present in the raw review output, but these mapped logically to the Critical/High/Medium/Low tiers.

The judge verified 10+ source references:
- `src/server.ts:198` -- type assertion confirmed
- `src/lib/llm-as-judge.ts:749-787` -- withTimeout race condition exists
- `src/lib/quality-metrics.ts:604-615` -- percentile bounds check missing
- `dashboard/src/api/server.ts:9` -- CORS hardcoded to localhost:5173
- `manifest.json` -- shows 6 tools vs 15 actual (verified)
- `package.json` vs `README.md` version mismatch (2.0.0 vs v2.0.1, verified)

## Session Telemetry

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Session ID | `b95c2314-2579-43cb-b5a7-86611356fbb6` |

| TaskCreate | 4 | Review + backlog tracking |
| TaskUpdate | 8 | Status transitions |
| Write | 2 | Review doc + backlog |
| Read | 2 | Existing file reads |
| Glob | 1 | Review directory check |
| Skill | 1 | git-commit-smart |

### Methodology Notes

Telemetry was extracted from `~/.claude/telemetry/traces-2026-02-14.jsonl` (91 spans matched session ID). The session launched 6 background code-reviewer agents; their internal tool calls are tracked separately by the agent framework and not reflected in the parent session's span count. Rule-based metrics were computed from hook spans only. Token counts were not available from hook telemetry (reported as 0); actual consumption was substantial given six parallel Opus agents processing ~26K lines of source code.

Task completion reflects the explicit TaskCreate/TaskUpdate lifecycle: 2 tasks created, both marked completed. The 6 background agents completed independently and their results were consumed via TaskOutput reads, but those completions are tracked in agent telemetry rather than parent task spans.
