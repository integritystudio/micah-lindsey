# Vita & Homage Pages Entity Analysis - Schema Enhancement

**Date:** November 11, 2025
**Purpose:** Identify organizations, technologies, projects, and people for entity-rich schema
**Target:** Professional CV (vita) and memorial tribute (homage) pages

---

## Overview

These two pages represent different aspects:
- **Vita:** Professional career, organizations, technologies, projects
- **Homage:** Deeply personal memorial tribute to Sumedh Joshi

Both can benefit from entity markup, with the vita focusing on professional organizations and technologies, and the homage honoring Sumedh and key people in his life.

## Privacy & Sensitivity Considerations

### Homage Page Special Handling

**This is a deeply personal memorial tribute.** Entity markup should:
- ✅ Honor Sumedh Joshi as primary subject
- ✅ Include memorial site link
- ⚠️ Consider privacy for living friends (some have Facebook URLs in original)
- ⚠️ Use generic references or names only for privacy
- ✅ Include philosophical influences Sumedh taught
- ✅ Include publications that featured him

**Recommendation:**
- **Tier 1 (Include fully):** Sumedh Joshi, publications (NYT, Burnt Orange Nation), philosophers
- **Tier 2 (Names only, no URLs):** Close friends/family for privacy
- **Tier 3 (Omit or generic):** Facebook-only referenced friends

---

## Schema Approach

### For Vita Page

**Use ProfilePage schema** (or AboutPage if ProfilePage not appropriate):
- Primary focus: Professional experience
- `mentions`: Organizations worked for
- `mentions`: Technologies used
- `mentions`: Open source projects
- `alumniOf`: Universities attended
- `knowsAbout`: Professional expertise areas

### For Homage Page

**Use AboutPage or Article schema:**
- Primary focus: Memorial tribute
- `about`: Sumedh Joshi (main subject)
- `mentions`: Philosophers who influenced them
- `mentions`: Publications that featured Sumedh
- `citation`: Literary quote
- Consider `memorialOf` or similar if appropriate
